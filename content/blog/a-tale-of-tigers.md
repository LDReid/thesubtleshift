>This is an excerpt from my book, Intimacy of Light, which explores how we can connect to other expressions of our soul to find healing, including some that are not human. This story is about my soul expression as a tiger and how it’s wisdom unfolded for me during my spiritual awakening.

# A Tale of Tigers

*From Intimacy of Light by Channa Dee*

The first time I understood that we could experience lives other than human was when I discovered my soul has been a tiger. When we start to tap into our soul’s expressions, often the story comes to us in chapters. We are shown glimpses of the lifetime in ways that are relevant to what we are experiencing now, and what we need to know at this moment. This lifetime unfolded in three chapters.

My first glimpse of my life as a tiger was during a meditation journey where I found myself looking at a little girl from the edge of a clearing. She was about 5 or 6 years old and I knew the setting was India. She was playing outside a simple hut, which I assumed was her home. As I continued to view this scene, I realized that I was not human, but a tiger, and the emotions I was feeling were very predatory. I was hunting that little girl. As a physical channel, I have the ability to embody these expressions, and I became very aware of what it feels like to be in the body of a tiger. I felt the power and bulk of this tremendous animal. Muscles taut and ready to pounce. I felt its hot breath, teeth, tail and huge paws. It was quite astounding.

I sat very still, watching and waiting. As present me experienced all this, I began to feel some distress that I may have killed this young girl. As the tiger readied itself to pounce, I was pulled out of meditation. That was all I was to know at that time. As I contemplated the vision, I came to the understanding that we can experience lives as animals, and within that framework, our souls have hunted and killed other life, including human. I began to accept that through this exploration of multidimensionality, I will learn things that I may not feel proud of.

The second chapter of the story was shown to me two years later. It began back at the place where I was hunting the little girl. As I moved into the clearing, the child screamed and men nearby chased me away. I was glad to learn that the tiger did not harm the girl. As the vision continued, I learned I was later captured and brought to a zoo. I could tell it was a long time ago. The cages were made of bamboo stakes and I had a sense that it may have been the turn of the century.

It was at this zoo that Jeremiah joined me as a tiger. He had been captured and placed in the same compound as me. We became mates and raised cubs together. The most extraordinary thing about this vision is the love and physicality I experienced as this tiger. I could tell Jeremiah and I loved each other very much. I could feel what it was like to wrestle him, bite his neck, and hold his fur in my mouth while swishing my tail. I now know what it’s like to nurture cubs and carry them around in my mouth. It’s an incredible feeling.

The emotions I felt around this experience were of love, even within the perspective of an animal. Although I was in a cage, I had my mate and my cubs and lived a content life, despite the circumstances. As I came out of meditation and thought about why I had been shown this, I began to understand it as a lesson about discovering the freedom to love under conditions that seemed to offer the very opposite of that. This happened in 2022 when I was experiencing the many restrictions due to COVID mandates and feeling those constraints very deeply. The timing of this soul journey provided me with insights into how to navigate my definitions of freedom.

The third chapter of my tiger life came a year later. At that time, I was dealing with a lot of stress around money. I had been through a marriage separation and was trying to build my business and care for my large property on my own. That day, I found myself on my knees trying to surrender to it all, and I asked my divine team of guides for clarity and assistance. I laid down to meditate and immediately felt my tiger self arrive. Jeremiah’s tiger was there too. I was brought back to our life in the Indian zoo. This time, the channelling of the tiger was very deep. I could feel her body and experience the animal’s consciousness. I growled so perfectly like a tiger that it freaked me out. I can’t imagine what the dogs were thinking as they lay on the bed beside me. I felt so powerful and fierce. I was shown that we didn’t spend our whole life in that zoo. Jeremiah had been digging around the fence in one corner of our compound and knocked down the walls enough to climb over them. We escaped with our cubs in our mouths and ran into the jungle to make a new home.

While the second chapter of this tiger tale was about finding freedom, safety, and happiness through love even in an environment where we are caged, this third chapter brought me a new lesson. I began to see that I had started to create a cage around me as I was reinventing my life at Ravenswood. I was not trapped there, but I needed to allow myself to be more out in the world. I had also been feeling paralyzed by the fear of scarcity and the responsibility of taking care of the place. This did not mean I was supposed to leave it behind, just not let it imprison me. It was also about feeling powerful and fierce and receiving a new sense of confidence.

I love my tiger self and I am deeply grateful for the lessons she has shown me. I know that she may show up again when she has another lesson to share. In the meantime, I have honoured the lessons my soul learned as the tiger and embodied the gifts of strength, wisdom, and freedom I was given. This is the purpose of multidimensionality and the value of exploring it.
